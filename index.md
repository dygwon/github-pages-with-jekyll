title: "PM in Training"
---

I've had an unconventional career path. I graduated from UC Irvine with a degree in Business Economics and started my professional career as a pastor serving Junior High School students in the local community. After a couple years I moved on to work in healthcare as a pharmacy technician with CVS Pharmacy. A couple years after that I chose to join the Air Force as an Acquisitions Officer and spent the last four years in Massachusetts working with defense contractors to develop and deliver advanced communication systems to AF bases throughout the country. Until now, service has been the primary focus of my career and I've always sought ways to give back. Recently, however, I decided to pursue a career for myself - one I know I can excel in - and I went back to school to get my MBA at NYU Stern to gain the business skills needed to be a great Product Manager. This site is about my journey.
